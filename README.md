Hey :wave:

### Check out my portfolio!

First we need to copy this repository and change directories to it.

```
git clone https://github.com/jager-js/jager-js.git 
cd jager-js
```

Then we must run the deployment script as root.

```
sudo sh portfolio-deployer.sh
```

Alternatively for Windows.

Start your cmd prompt as administrator.

```
git clone https://github.com/jager-js/jager-js.git 
cd jager-js
```

Then execute the script.

```
portfolio-deployer.cmd
```
**Node.js, NPM, and Git are required to run this.**
